# Microservices Architecture Empowering Online Banking Services: Secure, Efficient, and Scalable

## 1. What is Online Banking Service?

Online banking service is a digital extension of banking operations, allowing customers to perform various banking activities through internet channels (web or mobile applications). Typical functionalities include account management, fund transfers, bill payments, loan applications, investment management, and more. Many banks are increasingly providing services through online channels to better meet customer demands.

## 2. Differences Between Online Banking Systems and Other Software Systems

### 2.1 Higher Security Requirements

Online banking systems involve fund transactions, necessitating higher security. To ensure financial security, these systems implement multiple security measures, including encryption technology, identity authentication, risk control technology, etc.

### 2.2 Stricter Regulatory Requirements

Online banking systems, being in the financial services domain, are subject to stringent regulations. In New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, specific regulations govern online banking systems, ensuring transparency, integrity, and stability.

- **New Zealand:** In New Zealand, financial services are regulated by the Financial Markets Conduct Act and other regulations, ensuring transparency, integrity, and stability of financial services.

- **Australia:** In Australia, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) oversees financial services, and the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act outlines compliance requirements for financial institutions.

- **United States:** In the United States, agencies like the Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) regulate financial services. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires financial institutions to protect customer privacy and sets compliance standards.

Therefore, adhering to specific regulations and legal requirements in each country's regulatory framework is crucial for online banking systems to ensure their legality and compliance.

### 2.3 Higher System Complexity

Online banking systems need to integrate with the bank's core systems and offer various financial services, making their system complexity higher. To ensure system stability and reliability, the development and maintenance of online banking systems require additional investment.

### 2.4 Increased Data Sensitivity

Online banking systems store a large amount of customer information and transaction data with high sensitivity. Therefore, these systems need measures to protect data security and prevent data leaks.

## 3. Proliferation of Online Banking

The proliferation of online banking has flourished in the digital age. As of June 2023, notable data from New Zealand shows that 95% of adults utilize online banking services, with 80% managing transactions through mobile banking applications. Similarly, in Australia, data from September 2023 indicates that 94% of adults use online banking services, with 72% managing finances through mobile banking apps. In the United States, as of December 2023, 87% of adults use online banking services, with 64% operating through mobile banking applications. These statistics, sourced from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, further affirm the global prevalence of online banking services, becoming an integral part of modern life.

## 4. Features of Online Banking

Online banking services typically include the following features:

- **Account Management:** Customers can view their account balance, transaction history, and held assets at any time and from anywhere.
